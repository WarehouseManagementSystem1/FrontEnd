           "A WMS, or warehouse management system, is software that helps companies manage and control daily warehouse operations, from the moment goods and materials enter a distribution or fulfilment centre until the moment they leave. WMS software systems are a key component of supply chain management and offer real-time visibility into a companyâ€™s entire inventory, in warehouses and in transit. In addition to inventory management, a WMS offers tools for picking and packing processes, resource utilisation, analytics, and more."
